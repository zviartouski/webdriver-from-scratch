# webdriver-from-scratch
Repo contains code samples for the online eLearning WebDriver course hosted atÂ https://learn.epam.com/detailsPage?id=93e65671-c99b-42d7-ae15-f77a60cdfa53. 
Master branch contains full version split in packages according to the course structure. 
Other branches contain project structure for dedicated course module. 
For the sake of convenient work with certain module switch to relevant branch e.g.:

`$git checkout pageobject-with-pagefactory`

Mind Java config (at least Java 8) and WebDriver driver versions for each browser for proper code run.
